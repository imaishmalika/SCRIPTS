Install Puppet Master Server & Puppet Agent on Linux

This tutorial describes you step by step procedure to install and configure puppet master and puppet agent on Linux (RHEL7 / CentOS7).

In the previous article, we have explained about the below topics, Refer that also which are very essential to understand the puppet from the beginning.,

Our Lab Setup:
Description                      Master node                              Client node
Operating System             RHEL7 - 64 Bit                           RHEL7 - 64 Bit
Host Names                      puppet.learnitguide.net               client1.learnitguide.net
IP Address                        192.168.2.61                              192.168.2.62


Use the following instructions to install and configure puppet master and puppet agent on RHEL7/CentOS7. how to configure puppet server in linux, what is puppet in linux, puppet on linux, linux puppet server, puppet for linux, puppet tutorial linux, puppet server for linux, linux puppet tutorial, puppet linux, linux puppet tutorial for beginners, puppet server configuration on rhel7, puppet server configuration on centos7 Prerequisites:
1. Make sure both server "puppet" and "client1" are accessible.
2. Make an entry of each host in /etc/hosts for name resolution on both nodes as below or Configure it in DNS to resolve the IP, if you use server name instead of IP address. Read also How to Configure DNS Server on Linux (RHEL7 / CentOS7). But we use IP Address for reference.


cat /etc/hosts
192.168.2.61 puppet.learnitguide.net puppet
192.168.2.62 client1.learnitguide.net client1


3. Disable firewall on both nodes if enabled to avoid any issues during the configurations.

systemctl stop firewalld ; systemctl disable firewalld


Step 1: Install puppetlabs repository on both nodes

Update the packages and install the puppetlabs repo using the below command.

yum -y update
yum -y install http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-7.noarch.rpm


Once it is installed, you could see a repo file generated under /etc/yum.repos.d folder.

ll /etc/yum.repos.d/puppetlabs.repo
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1550 Sep  9 06:04 /etc/yum.repos.d/puppetlabs.repo


Step 2: Install required package on the master node "puppet"

[root @puppet ~]# yum -y install puppet-server


Step 3: Configure the puppet master server "puppet"

/etc/puppet/puppet.conf is the Puppet Configuration file, edit the file to define the friendly dns hostnames and certificate name for the puppet master node in the [main] section.
[main]
dns_alt_names = puppet, puppet.learnitguide.net
certname=puppet


Step 4: Generate the certificate from the puppet master node "puppet" ,puppet server installation and configuration in linux, puppet configuration in linux step by step, puppet client configuration in linux, puppet configuration example, redhat puppet configuration, puppet server configuration in ubuntu step by step, puppet server linux, puppet in linux


After executing the below command to generate the certificate, press "CTRL + C" to cancel when you see the puppet version as below and start the "puppetmaster" service.


[root @puppet ~]# sudo -u puppet puppet master --no-daemonize --verbose

Notice: Starting Puppet master version 3.8.7
^CNotice: Caught INT; exiting



Start and enable the puppetmaster service.

[root @puppet ~]# systemctl start puppetmaster
[root @puppet ~]# systemctl enable puppetmaster



Step 5: Install Puppet agent packages on the client node "client1"

[root @client1 ~]# yum -y install puppet


Step 6: Configure the puppet agent on the client node "client1"

Again /etc/puppet/puppet.conf is the Puppet Configuration file, edit the file to define the puppet master node "puppet" in the [agent] section.
[agent]
server = puppet.learnitguide.net



Step 7: Generate the signing request certificate from the puppet agent node "client1"

[root @client1 ~]# puppet agent -t

Info: Caching certificate for ca
Info: csr_attributes file loading from /etc/puppet/csr_attributes.yaml
Info: Creating a new SSL certificate request for client1.learnitguide.net
Info: Certificate Request fingerprint (SHA256): B7:B0:8D:55:08:D1:5A:2D:31:A6:AE:49:40:DA:30:F9:A2:03:37:F7:6A:DC:37:4E:35:B2:54:36:F0:75:3A:62
Info: Caching certificate for ca
Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled



Step 8: List the certificates to be signed from the puppet master node "puppet" and sign it.

[root@puppet ~]# puppet cert list


"client1.learnitguide.net" (SHA256) B7:B0:8D:55:08:D1:5A:2D:31:A6:AE:49:40:DA:30:F9:A2:03:37:F7:6A:DC:37:4E:35:B2:54:36:F0:75:3A:62


[root@puppet ~]# puppet cert sign client1.learnitguide.net


Notice: Signed certificate request for client1.learnitguide.net
Notice: Removing file Puppet::SSL::CertificateRequest client1.learnitguide.net at '/var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/requests/client1.learnitguide.net.pem'


Start and enable the puppet agent service.

[root@client1 ~]# systemctl start puppet
[root@client1 ~]# systemctl enable puppet


Step 9: Verify the certificate signed properly with the puppet master node?

[root@client1 ~]# puppet agent --fingerprint

(SHA256) B7:B0:8D:55:08:D1:5A:2D:31:A6:AE:49:40:DA:30:F9:A2:03:37:F7:6A:DC:37:4E:35:B2:54:36:F0:75:3A:62


Thats all about Puppet master and puppet agent installation and configuration.
